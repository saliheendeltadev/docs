## facets

**_Array of string, Optional_**


Faceting gives you an idea of what attributes are available within your search. This can help end users select from various facets and filter listings, providing a great front-end experience for the end users.

Buildify currently supports plenty of attributes for facets such as:

* type
* agents
* owners
* country
* builders
* amenities
* architects
* brokerages
* communities
* salesCentres
* neighbourhood
* cityOrDistrict
* municipalities
* salesCompanies
* marketingCompanies

A simple run to `getFacetCounts` with `facets=["*"]` will provide all the available facets with their counts.

Within your search query, you can use `facets=["amenities"]` to retrieve counts of each of the amenities available within your search.

Facets are returned in the response with the `facets` key, where each object represents a facet.

> Returned facet counts represent the whole search result,s not just the paginated one (results that are there but not returned due to pagination).

Now reinvented as a grand new residence, it’s ready for a new era of memorable nights in.\n",
