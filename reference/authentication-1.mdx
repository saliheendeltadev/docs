Authentication enables you to manage all aspects of user identity, such as accessing the API endpoints.
Buildify employs basic authentication using the **API Key**.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS, and API requests without authentication will fail.

#### API Key

Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. To authenticate with Buildify API endpoints, you must provide the API Key in the header, as shown below.

```Bash Authentication Header

`x-api-key: <Your_API_Key>'
```

For example, when you want to search listings, you will use the `GET - Search Listings` endpoint. In this scenario, you can send an API request by adding your API Key in the Authentication header to retrieve the listings information.

```Bash Search Listings Sample

     curl --request GET \
          --url https://api.getbuildify.com/v1/search_listings \
          --header 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
          --header 'accept: application/json'
```

> Your API keys carry many concessions, so keep them safe! Do not share your secret API keys on publicly accessible sites.
