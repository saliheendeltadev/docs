We dedicated this article for you to help solve errors in our API. Have a look at the error description below, or go straight to the causes and suggestions.

## Response Codes

We use the HTTP status code, where status codes in the range `2xx` indicate success, status codes in the range `4xx` indicate failure, and status codes in the range `5xx` indicate a server fault.

See the table below for further information:

| Status Code                          | Description                                       |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| 200 - ✅ Success                      | Request successfully processed/created.           |
| 400 - ❌ Bad Request                  | The request was unacceptable.                     |
| 403 - ❌ Forbidden                    | You don't have permission to perform the request. |
| 404 - ❌ Not Found                    | The requested resource doesn't exist.             |

## Error Troubleshoots

Here is our recommendation for handling errors:

### 400 - Bad Request

<Icon icon="bomb" /> **Cause**: This error occurs because of invalid syntax or missing a required parameter.<br/>
<Icon icon="screwdriver-wrench" /> **Solution**: Recheck the request that you input. Make sure it has followed the requirements.

### 403 - Forbidden

<Icon icon="bomb" /> **Cause**: This error occurs when you cannot access the requested page.<br/>
<Icon icon="screwdriver-wrench" /> **Solution**: Double-check the URL and make sure you input an actual web page file name and extension.

### 404 - Not Found

<Icon icon="bomb" /> **Cause**: This error occurs because you provided the wrong URL or the ID you requested is not associated with Buildify.<br/>
<Icon icon="screwdriver-wrench" /> **Solution**: Use the correct URL (check for typos and our API documentation carefully).

### 500 - Internal Server Error

<Icon icon="bomb" /> **Cause**: This error occurs when Buildify has encountered an internal system error.<br/>
<Icon icon="screwdriver-wrench" /> **Solution**: You can retry later, or please get in touch with our support if you keep getting this error.
