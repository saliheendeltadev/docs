title: "Pagination"
icon: rectangle-list
description: Since objects can be big enough, with a size as large as 10KBs per object, results can be paginated to avoid pulling all data at once, improving latency.
---

## page

**_Integer, Optional, Default: 0_**

Specify the page to retrieve.
You must use this setting if you wish to retrieve specific pages.

**Notes:**

* Page-numbering is based on the value of `perPage`. If `perPage`\=20, then `page=0` will display the first 20 results, and `page=2` will display the hits from 41 to 60.
* Page numbers are zero-based. Therefore, to retrieve the tenth page, you need to set `page=9`.
* You can see the number of available pages in the value of `pages` in the JSON response to the search query.
* If you send a request for a page that doesn’t exist or is out of range when the page is greater than or equal to `pages`, Buildify doesn’t respond with an error. Instead, the response will display '0'.

## perPage

**_Integer, Optional, Default: 20_**

Sets the number of results per page.

1000 is the maximum number of results you can have per page.
