This document outlines the differences between Pro, Lite, and Sandbox modes for the GetBuildify API, along with information on supported provinces.

## 1\. API Products

The GetBuildify API offers three access modes:

1. **Pro**: This mode provides unlimited access to all available data:
   * Fetch an unlimited number of resources at once.
   * View Listings with any selling status.
   * Attach profiles (agents, builders, brokerages, interior designers, etc) or listings to response based on provided references.
   * Include document files and floor plans for Listings.
   Pro is ideal for users who need full access to all Realtor data.
2. **Lite**: This mode is designed for basic use cases. It allows you to fetch a limited number of resources at once:
   * Includes Listings with specific selling statuses: **Selling Now** and **Registration**.
   * Does not allow aggregating profiles or listings data through references parameter.
   * Does not include document files and floor plans for Listings.
   Lite is a good option for users who only need access to a subset of data or who are concerned about data usage.
3. **Sandbox**: This mode uses test data, it might not be accurate at all times.
   * Only allow to fetch 5 resources at once.
   * Do not allow to attach profiles or Listings.
   * Include floor plans for Listings.
   Sandbox is a good way to test your integration with the Realtor API before moving to a production environment.

**Construct the API endpoint URL**: Combine the province abbreviation and your chosen mode into the following format:

* `api.getbuildify.com/v1/<province_abbreviation>` (Pro mode).
* `api.getbuildify.com/v1-lite/<province_abbreviation>` (Lite mode).
* `api.getbuildify.com/v1-sandbox/<province_abbreviation>` (Sandbox mode).

For example:

* To access Pro data for Ontario, use `api.getbuildify.com/v1/on`.
* To access Lite data for British Columbia, use `api.getbuildify.com/v1-lite/bc`.

**Default Province**: If you do not specify a province abbreviation in the URL, Ontario (on) will be used by default.
