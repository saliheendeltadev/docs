In addition to the query parameters we had for listing endpoints, the profiles endpoint has one additional parameter called **collection**.

Every listing comprises different builders, marketers, interiorDesigner, and many more. These can have a huge blob of data by themselves. To manage data efficiently, Buildify manages certain objects into different collections and references them within the listing object. Learn more about referencing [here](/reference/referrencing)

The `collection` parameter helps you search for or retrieve your profiles from a specific collection.

Buildify supports the following collections:

| Collection Name                                   | Referred As        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| [Architects](/reference/architect)                | architects         |
| [Builders](/reference/builder)                    | builders           |
| [InteriorDesigners](/reference/interior-designer) | interiorDesigners  |
| [Marketers](/reference/marketer)                  | marketingCompanies |
